I﻿'m a performance psychologist and academic at the University of Queensland. I'm trying to do as much good as I can, t﻿rying to be a good ancestor, and trying to help others do the same.

I think it's hard to choose what problems to focus on, and to find the best approaches to solving them. I work toward answering these questions using systematic reviews and Delphi studies because they pull together all the best evidence and expert opinion to clarify what we know.

I﻿ think universities are slow to translate what they know into practice, and changing behaviour is tough. I try to solve this problem using motivating, engaging, and evidence-based online learning. I blend online learning with quality human support because doing this online makes it scalable, but a human in the loop makes it effective.
